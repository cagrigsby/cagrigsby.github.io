#### 2018-2020
* Graduated with a Computer Science Bachelor Degree with Distinction, from The University of Engineering and Technology - Vietnam National University (UET - VNU).
* Focused on identifying Vietnamese antonymous word-pairs from other semantic relations used many statistical machine learning techniques and conducted a lot of researches in previously well-known relevant papers. 

* Refactored and developed a web application helps editors to edit Japanese-Vietnamese bilingual sentences or words. Thanks to this application, editors work efficiently. The more details about the application are in the following links.
    * [*Link to internship report - guidance to the web application*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y7XfaogJ1cKG2XfF1Vd-J0flC6VfjQtS/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
